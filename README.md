Weight Bucket Shipping Calculator for Spree
=================

A shipping calculator for [Spree](http://spreecommerce.com) that
calculates shipping costs based on weight buckets. Ranges of package
weights are assigned a price and the shipping cost worked out based on
the total weight of the products in the cart.

Installation
------------

Add spree_weight_bucket to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_weight_bucket', :git => "git@github.com:terje/spree-weight-bucket.git"
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_weight_bucket:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_weight_bucket/factories'
```
